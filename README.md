The study of wearable and handheld sensors recognizing human activity improved our understanding of human behaviours and human objectives.
Many academics seek to identify the activities of a user from raw data using the fewest necessary resources. In this article, we propose
a network of profound beliefs, a full-service architecture for the recognition of activities (DBN-LSTM). This DBN-LSTM method improves the
human predictability of raw data and reduces the complexity of the model as well as the requirement for comprehensive workmanship. A 
geographically and temporally rich network is CNN-LSTM. Our proposed model for the UCI HAR Public Data Set can achieve 99% accuracy 
and 92% precision.

###  RESTRICTED BOLTZMANN MACHINE EQUATION
These are neural networks when they operate in an unsupervised or stochastic manner. According to Hinton [20], they can be used 
to reduce size, classify, correlate, and conduct regressions. In each RBM, there are two levels, one that is visible and another
that is hidden within the DBM. The two layers are connected and do not have connections within a layer. It is possible to determine 
the intrinsic relationship among binary data by usingthe properties of RBMs, whose energy functions are specified as follows:
